3. My goal is to become a developer. At the age of 4, I got to know the computer at the user level, and since then it has been an integral part of my life.
I have mastered audio, photo and video editors at a fairly high level, and now I would like to acquire new knowledge and skills in the field of IT. In my opinion, this area is the most interesting and promising today.           
Among my strengths, I would note dedication, perseverance and a constant desire to learn something new.
